## Hi, I'm Pranati 👋

I build ML systems that extract reliable signals from complex, noisy data—whether that's decoding intent from neural activity, evaluating AI reasoning under adversarial conditions, or making sense of massive research corpora.

Currently: MS in CS at Columbia, working on neural decoding and neuro-inspired ML architectures. 
Previously: shipped production ML at Disney Streaming.

Core research areas
🧠 Neural signal processing & BCIs
Building robust classifiers for physiological data where noise, artifacts, and confounds are the norm. Focus: turning messy EEG/eye-tracking signals into actionable predictions about human cognitive states.
🤖 AI robustness & evaluation
Testing whether AI systems maintain reliable reasoning under adversarial pressure, distribution shift, and edge cases. Focus: finding failure modes before they matter.
📚 Knowledge systems & retrieval
Building infrastructure for organizing and accessing complex information at scale. Focus: making large knowledge bases actually usable for both humans and AI systems.
